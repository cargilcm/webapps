to run the script you need your cgi script to be executable. the script assumes this to be apache's default and that the system on which mailman is installed runs ubuntu or a distro with comparable relative locations for the mailman public archives. presumably this script will reveal (read: intermix) results from different lists on the same server in the results page, which may prove good or bad depending how you look at it
